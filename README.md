## Process-Creation-Hierarchy

 - This C program simulates the creation and destruction of processes when implemented as a linked list. It utilizes dynamic memory allocation to implement the linked list and follows a process creation hierarchy of PCBs (Process Control Blocks).

## **Through the development of this project, I gained expertise in:**

  - Implementing a linked list using dynamic memory allocation in C
  - Implementing a process creation hierarchy of PCBs
  
## **This program offers the following benefits:**

 - Improved understanding of process management: By simulating the creation and destruction of processes, I gained a deeper understanding of how processes are managed in a computer system.
 - Enhanced problem-solving skills: Implementing a linked list required me to think critically and creatively to find solutions to various challenges.
 
 Overall, the Process-Creation-Hierarchy program is a valuable tool for improving my understanding of process management and enhancing my problem-solving skills. It could be useful for others seeking to learn about these concepts as well.
